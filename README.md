# Case_Study_1_Google_Data_Analytics
I started the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification course from Coursera. In the last segment there was a capstone project which included two distinct case studies. 
It is the 1st case study which involves the analysis of a bike share trip data from Cyclistic. I used the public dataset from Kaggle.
I would also like to thank Abdullah Temidayo, since during my completion of this case study I took help from the article of this guy. He did a wonderful job. His article is available in Medium.

I used R programming language during the analysis phase due to its robust features. 
Best of luck for everyone who is trying to learn data analytics from scratch like me.
